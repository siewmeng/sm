**enum**  
It stands for **enumeration**. It is a user-defined datatype that has a finite set of values.

Let's consider the following string variable.  

```markdown
var colour:String

colour="Red"      // assigned Red
colour="Green"    // change to Green
colour="Yellow"   // change to Yellow

... and so on
```  
We can even assign non-colour word to this variable, as long as the data type is a string.
```
colour="hello!"
```
This is nothing wrong syntactically, however it does not sound so correct logically. Look at the example below.
```
var colour:String
colour="Hello!"

switch colour {
case "Red":
    print("\(colour) light, cars stop.")
case "Green":
    print("\(colour) light, cars move.")
case "Yellow":
    print("\(colour) light, cars stopping.")
default:
    print("\(colour) light, invalid signal.")
}
```
When executed, will print the following which sound funny!
```
Hello! light, invalid signal.
```
To avoid such situation from arising, we restrict colour to a set of values i.e. only allows Red, Green and Yellow.  

First of all, we define a data type using keyword **enum** and let's call it MyColour. MyColour has 3 members; Red, Green and Yellow. *Please note that they are just identifiers and no string data types.*

```
enum MyColour {
    case Red
    case Green
    case Yellow
}
```

Now, declare variable colour as MyColour data type, and assign it a pre-defined value.
```
var colour:MyColour

colour=.Red
```
Please note that there must be a dot before the identifier Red.  
  
Below are some of the "correct" and "incorrect" assignments.
```
colour=Red      // incorrect
colour="Red"    // incorrect
colour=.Purple  // incorrect as Purple is not a member of MyColour

colour=.Red         // correct
colour=Mycolour.Red // correct
```
By declaring variable *colour* as the user-defined type MyColour, its values are now restricted to .Red, .Green and .Yellow. Just a reminder, .Red, .Green and .Yellow are not strings. They are identifiers defined within MyColour.
  
Now, re-write the above example as:
```
enum MyColour {
    case Red
    case Green
    case Yellow
}
var colour:MyColour

colour = .Red

switch colour {
case .Red:
    print("\(colour) light, cars stop.")
case .Green:
    print("\(colour) light, cars move.")
case .Yellow:
    print("\(colour) light, cars stopping.")
}
```
Please note that the *default:* case in the above *switch* can be removed as all cases have been covered.  
Since no other values besides .Red, .Green and .Yellow are allowed, one of the three printed outputs is expected.  

When executed, it will print
```
Red light, cars stop.
```
