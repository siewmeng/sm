**enum**  
It stands for **enumeration**. It is a user-defined datatype that has a finite set of values.

Let's consider the following string variable.  

```markdown
var colour:String="Red"

colour="Blue"
colour="Yellow"

... and so on
```  
We can even assign non-colour word to this variable, as long as the data type is a string.
```
colour="hello!"
```
This is nothing wrong syntactically, however it does not sound so correct logically.  
To avoid such situation, we restrict the values to a set of strings, e.g. only allows "Red", "Green" and "Yellow".
